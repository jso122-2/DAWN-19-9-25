# 🌅 DAWN Enhanced CLI Interface

A comprehensive command-line interface for the DAWN consciousness system that provides deep access to all subsystems, monitoring, debugging, and control capabilities.

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 🔧 Logging Duplication Fix
- **Problem**: Repetitive logging messages during DAWN boot showing "Auto-initializing universal JSON logging" and "Auto-discovered X new objects"
- **Root Cause**: Auto-initialization was running multiple times and discovery messages were at INFO level
- **Solution**: 
  - Added initialization guard to prevent multiple auto-initialization
  - Changed repetitive discovery messages from INFO to DEBUG level
  - This reduces startup noise while maintaining functionality

### 🚀 Enhanced CLI Interface
- **Problem**: Basic CLI interface with only 7 commands (status, state, modules, telemetry, health, help, quit)
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive CLI with 40+ commands organized into 9 categories

## 🎯 Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Launch interactive mode
./cli

# Or directly with python
python3 dawn_enhanced_cli.py

# Run single commands
./cli status
./cli start --mode=daemon
./cli dashboard --refresh=3
```

### Interactive Mode
```
dawn-cli 🟢 > help
dawn-cli 🟢 > start
dawn-cli 🟢 > dashboard
dawn-cli 🟢 > consciousness coherence
dawn-cli 🟢 > quit
```
