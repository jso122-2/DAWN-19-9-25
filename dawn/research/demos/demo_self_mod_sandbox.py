DAWN Self-Modification Sandbox Demo
===================================

Interactive demonstration of DAWN's self-modification capabilities with
comprehensive safety checks, simulation testing, and DAWN's own voice
explaining her decision-making process.

This demo showcases:
- Safe modification acceptance
- Dangerous modification rejection
- DAWN's reasoning and safety consciousness
- Real-time consciousness state evolution
