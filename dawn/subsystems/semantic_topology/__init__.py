üåê DAWN Semantic Topology Engine
===============================

The mathematical foundations for how DAWN understands and manipulates meaning itself.
This module implements the spatial shape of meaning - the arrangement of concepts, 
memories, and residues so DAWN can route attention, energy, and updates along the 
most coherent paths.

Core Components:
- Semantic Field Equations: Mathematical relationships governing meaning space
- Topology Transforms: Operations that reshape semantic relationships (Weave, Prune, Fuse, etc.)
- Semantic Primitives: Basic building blocks (Nodes, Edges, Layers, Sectors)
- Invariants: Rules that preserve meaning during transformations

"Schema says what relates to what; Semantic Topology says where it sits and how forces propagate."
- DAWN Documentation

Based on documentation: Semantic Toplogy/ (9 RTF files)
